development steps for the simulator

v1 i would like to get the frontend and backend connection down already.

features:

two monsters visible on screen
monsters have health totals
    monster health bar is visible on screen
    monster health numbers are visible
monsters can attack to deal x amount of damage to the other monster
    done through buttons on left and right of screen?
box at the bottom of the screen where text is printed, narrating the 'battle'

v2 we should introduce different damages of moves and potentially stat interactions

add stats to the monsters
perform stat calculations during monster combat
add extra moves to monsters
